                    <p>ClientTell is focused on providing sex-workers a platform to offer feedback about the dates they’ve been on in order to share with their fellow sex-worker communities.
                    This application allows sex workers to share intricate details about  a given date they’ve been on, rating clients by important, and relevant information that impacts sex-workers.
                    This will allow other sex-workers to choose whether or not this is a client they would be interested in going out with.
                    ClienTell intends to stay away from disempowering language that victimizes sex-workers, and instead allows for an empowering, sex-positive, de-stigmatizing  environment.</p>
